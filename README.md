# Cookie-Clicker

In this project, Selenium webdriver is used to automate the web-based game Cookie Clicker (http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/). It automatically clicks on the cookie instead of manually clicking on it and select upgrades and purchase them completely automatically. 

The game is, we have to click on a big giant cookie as fast as we can, and once we have got some cookies, we can buy certain upgrades like, a cursor which will click on the cookie automatically and when we have more cookies, we can buy some other updates like gradma, who will bake more cookies.

We can make our bot to decide which add ons to buy to make sense depending upon the money we have and we can make our bot contineously click to make more cookies. The goal is, we are trying to max out the cookies per second rating. The more add ons we have buyed and more often clicked on the cookie, then the more cookies per second we can bake.

Here, the selenium webdriver automatically clicks on the cookie. Once we have clicked for 5 seconds, it will see which is the highest value add on we can buy and we will buy it to help with the game. The bot will play this game for 5 minute and will see what is the cookies per second rating.
